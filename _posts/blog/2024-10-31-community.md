What is community? My personal definition is: A group of people bonded by common interests who   evolve together. 

The intensity of the feeling of connection one feels in a community is in proportion to the difference between the values and ideals of the community members and the people in one's usual social surroundings.  The contrast between your ordinary, banal life with the rich mental life experienced in an intellectual community makes the sense of belonging more poignant. I know this because I live this. I have friends who live this. When you are surrounded by average people, belonging in a community of above average indivduals can seem like a divine experience.


I have been talking abstractly, now let me draw on my own experiences to make it more concrete. I have always been a tad different. I did not know this until I got to high school and realised I had interests that were quite different from most students. I loved books about psychology, philosophy, history and languages. I loved spending  hours learning French even though it was not a course I was offering. Spending time learning something that is not required, something you do not need grades for ?, unheard of in the Ghanaian high school where material was learnt (barely) just to pass exams. I do not mean to say that the students who did this were in any way inferior. In fact I was an accomplice in this when it came to subjects I saw as unimportant, a label I gave most of the subjects I was offering. I was only invested in the things that interested me, and most of those things were completely outside the cirriculum. [^1] 


However I made friends who resembled me in a way. They were also different. They understood my unusal interests and had unusal interests of their own. Together we thrived, had fun and encouraged each other to do more and be more. At the time, I did not realise that we formed a community of our own, separated by our atypical interests.


Back then, I did not see the need to be surrounded by like minded people. My being surrounded by those wonderful friends was simply a chance happening. However, as I grew - particularly after I moved to Europe - I realised that it was becoming harder for me to focus on my interests. It was not this hard when I had my friends around me to motivate me with interesting discussions and mutual admiration. Now, when I read, I forgot the material almost instantly. When I tried to read "hard books", I could barely understand the concepts presented. My French, which I spent so many hours learning joyously in school, was not improving. I was watching more short form content and hating myself for it. In short, I was beocoming like the people around me and it was a horrifying realisation. [^2]

Suddenly, a relationship I had  an old friend I made in university rekindled. We had always been good friends and I always knew that he and I were alike in that we were both "unonventional" [^3] and smart . Almost overnight, I felt myself redrawn to my old, brain-friendly interests. He made me want to be smarter but without the pressure that comes with that desire. There is a certain kind of pressure that comes with being smart in which you feel as though that is your whole personality and when you lose it, you become a lesser version of yourself. It is a very unheathy way of thinking . I do still feel like I am not as smart as I used to be, but I have accepted it now. I know that being smart is not the end goal but being able to enjoy life, enjoying what you learn and being satisfied with whoever you are at whatever stage in Life, is what matters. 


He put into concrete words this idea of a community, of having like minded people surrounding you. I have always known that your environment influences you in conscious and subconscious ways but I had only considered the negative cases, as in with my TikTok dependent siblings and I. I paid little attention to how beneficial the influence of a higher minded community could be. Now I yearn for the benefiits of such a community. I have my friend, yes, but it is different when there is a larger group. A community and not just a couple. There there will be more ideas to digest, more sounding boards to bounce your thoughts off of, more personalities to examine, more minds to distill, just more of everything.


Thanks to the Internet, it is unbelievably easy to join spaces where people gather based on a common interest. We have Discord writing groups, Facebook crotchet groups, subreddits for conoisseurs of rare lobsters. But for some reason, joining those groups does not feel authentic to me. I want to join an organically created community. I do not want to join a group that was made with a goal in mind and is made up of random people. It may sound picky but I just do not feel that joining these pre-made groups would bring me the sense of connection that I crave. I want to join a community that forms in the same way a friendship group does, without planning and thought. Just a group of souls who found each other and built a relationship togther.

### Footnotes
[^1]:  I must note that people from different backgrounds may not see these interests as out of the ordinary, but in the society I come from -  a middle class Ghanaian town - they were. 

[^2]: To give context, I was usually in the company of my siblings, who are your quintessential social media addicts. I had only sparse digital contact with my friends in Ghana. 

[^3]: Unconventional meaning we did not have the same values, ideals and behaviours as the members of the society we belonged to. His is even more profound because he is from a lower middle class community where deliquency and broken homes are the norm.
