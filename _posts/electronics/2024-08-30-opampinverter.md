An operational amplifier (op-amp) inverter circuit is a common configuration that produces an output signal that is 180 degrees out of phase with the input. In this setup, the input signal is applied to the inverting terminal of the op-amp, while the non-inverting terminal is typically grounded.

The inverter circuit relies on negative feedback, which is achieved by connecting a resistor from the output back to the inverting input. This feedback stabilizes the output and determines the gain of the circuit. The output signal is an amplified version of the input signal, but it is inverted, meaning that when the input signal goes positive, the output signal goes negative, and vice versa.

This configuration is widely used in signal processing applications, such as audio systems and analog computing, because it effectively allows for signal manipulation and amplification with a simple design.
